# Machine learning

> Machine learning algorithm implementations and explanations

## Notebooks

The notebooks contains derivations and explanations of each method followed by implementations and example usage on well know data sets

## machine_learning

This contains the source code for each of the implementations (these are the same as in each notebook)
